Win32 minesweeper

**NOTE: This repository is DEPRECATED and has been moved to [My_Minesweeper](https://github.com/wqhanginge/My_Minesweeper).**

This program is trying to rebuild the classical winmine.exe, which is a minesweeper game on Windows XP.  
The release version of this program is compiled by VS 2022 on Windows 10 by default.  
Just for entertainment. Using emojis from Baidu Tieba.
